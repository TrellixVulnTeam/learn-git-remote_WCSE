## Welcome to my Github.io
This is repository for learning to scrapping web data from Wikipedia.

The reason I created this project: As the first step, I want to scrape data and handle them myself. So I choosed Wikipedia, with the support from **BeautifulSoup** library (Python). I also use **Streamlit** library to build a tiny app.

I know it seems complex doing web scraping manually while Wiki has bunch of convenient APIs for this, but I want to start simply and stupidly :grin:.

You can try it by clone the repo, install necessary dependencies with pip (I provided the requirements.txt, you're very welcome). Or use can use the virtual environment that I included (More about this [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)).

Run the app by use command:

```python
streamlit run my_app.py
```

Then, head to your http://localhost:8501 and check the app.

Have a nice day!
